<P>System engineering is a process that helps you manage the complexity of large systems. It’s a way to ensure that all of the different parts of a system work together seamlessly and efficiently. System engineering has been around for many years, and there are now some great tools and techniques available to help you get the most out of this approach.
    In order to understand system engineering, it is first necessary to understand what a “system” is. A system can be thought of as a group of components that interact with each other to achieve a specific goal. The term “system” can be used to refer to anything from a simple machine (like a car) to a complex network (like the internet).
