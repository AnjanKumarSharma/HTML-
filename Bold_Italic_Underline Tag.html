    <p><b>Curtains forcing their will</b>
        <br><i>against the wind,</i>
        <!-- <br><u>children sleep, -->
        <br>exchanging dreams with
        <br>seraphim. The city
        <br>drags itself awake on
        <br>subway straps; and
        <br>I, an alarm, awake as a
        <br>rumor of war,
        <br>lie stretching into dawn,
        <br>unasked and unheeded.</u></p>
